In No Man's Sky, each star is the light of a distant sun, orbiting inhabited planets that you can go to if you wish. Move freely between the expanses of deep space and the surfaces of planets, without any loading screens and restrictions. In this endless, procedurally generated universe, you will discover places and creatures that you have not seen before and are probably unlikely to see ever again.



Embark on an epic journey

The center of the galaxy is an extremely strong pulsation, attracting everyone who wants to reveal the true nature of the cosmos. However, when faced with hostile creatures and cruel pirates, you will see that death is expensive, and survival comes down to choosing options to improve your ship, weapons and costume.



Find your own destiny

Your journey through No Man's Sky depends solely on you. Perhaps you will become a fighter who takes away wealth from weaklings
